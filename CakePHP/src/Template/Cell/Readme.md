### What is a cell?
A cell is a Element with Query possibilities, it has his own controller. \
A cell is typically used for a news slider, to pull "the last 5 new columns" for the complete element.
This means that if you dont have to use any given variable from the controller, and the item doesnt has any logic, \
this typically results in using a element instead of a cell.
